# Vehicle-Database

In the first part of the project, I imported 4 CSV files with a table in each CSV file. I then form a relational model to get the desired table out of all 4 tables. During this database project, I learnt database design as well as relational databases. PostgreSQL was used in this project.

On the second part of the project, I imported the postgreSQL relational database into Power BI, where I used PowerQuery M Formula to find price per product. After completing the formula, I created a data visualisation to display the price per product.
